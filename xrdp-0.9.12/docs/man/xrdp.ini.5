.SH "NAME"
\fBxrdp.ini\fR \- Configuration file for \fBxrdp\fR(8)

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the man page for \fBxrdp.ini\fR, \fBxrdp\fR(8) configuration file.
It is composed by a number of sections, each one composed by a section name, enclosed by square brackets, followed by a list of \fI<parameter>\fR=\fI<value>\fR lines.

\fBxrdp.ini\fR supports the following sections:

.TP
\fB[Globals]\fP \- sets some global configuration settings for \fBxrdp\fR(8).

.TP
\fB[Logging]\fP \- logging subsystem parameters

.TP
\fB[Channels]\fP \- channel subsystem parameters

.LP
All options and values (except for file names and paths) are case insensitive, and are described in detail below.

.SH "GLOBALS"
The options to be specified in the \fB[Globals]\fR section are the following:

.TP

Specify xrdp listening address. If not specified, defaults to 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces).

.TP
\fBautorun\fP=\fIsession_name\fP
Section name for automatic login. If set and the client supplies valid
username and password, the user will be logged in automatically using the
connection specified by \fIsession_name\fP.

If \fIsession_name\fP is empty, the \fBLOGIN DOMAIN\fR from the client
with be used to select the section. If no domain name is supplied, the
first suitable section will be used for automatic login.

If set to \fB1\fR, \fBtrue\fR or \fByes\fR this option enables bitmap compression in \fBxrdp\fR(8).

.TP
\fBbulk_compression\fP=\fI[true|false]\fP
If set to \fB1\fR, \fBtrue\fR or \fByes\fR this option enables compression of bulk data in \fBxrdp\fR(8).

.TP
\fBcertificate\fP=\fI/path/to/certificate\fP
.TP

.TP
\fBchannel_code\fP=\fI[true|false]\fP
If set to \fB0\fR, \fBfalse\fR or \fBno\fR this option disables all channels \fBxrdp\fR(8).

.TP
\fBcrypt_level\fP=\fI[low|medium|high|fips]\fP
.\" <http://blogs.msdn.com/b/openspecification/archive/2011/12/08/encryption-negotiation-in-rdp-connection.aspx>
Regulate encryption level of Standard RDP Security.
This parameter is effective only if \fBsecurity_layer\fP is set to \fBrdp\fP or \fBnegotiate\fP.

Encryption in Standard RDP Security is controlled by two settings: \fIEncryption Level\fP
and \fIEncryption Method\fP.  The only supported \fIEncryption Method\fP are \fB40BIT_ENCRYPTION\fP
and \fB128BIT_ENCRYPTION\fP. \fB56BIT_ENCRYPTION\fP is not supported.
This option controls the \fIEncryption Level\fP:
.RS 8
.TP
.B low
All data sent from the client to the server is protected by encryption based on
the maximum key strength supported by the client.
.I This is the only level that the traffic sent by the server to client is not encrypted.
.TP
.B medium
All data sent between the client and the server is protected by encryption based on
the maximum key strength supported by the client (client compatible).
.TP
.B high
All data sent between the client and the server is protected by encryption based on
the server's maximum key strength (sever compatible).
.TP
.B fips
All data sent between the client and server is protected using Federal Information
Processing Standard 140-1 validated encryption methods.
.I This level is required for Windows clients (mstsc.exe) if the client's group policy
.I enforces FIPS-compliance mode.
.RE

.TP
\fBfork\fP=\fI[true|false]\fP

.TP
\fBrequire_credentials\fP=\fI[true|false]\fP
If set to \fB1\fP, \fBtrue\fP or \fByes\fP, \fBxrdp\fP requires clients to include username and
password initial connection phase. In other words, xrdp doesn't allow clients to show login
screen if set to true. If not specified, defaults to \fBfalse\fP.

Standard RDP Security, which is not safe from man-in-the-middle attack, is used. The encryption level
of Standard RDP Security is controlled by \fBcrypt_level\fP.

.TP
.B negotiate

.RE

.TP
\fBssl_protocols\fP=\fI[SSLv3] [TLSv1] [TLSv1.1] [TLSv1.2] [TLSv1.3]\fP
Enables the specified SSL/TLS protocols. Each value should be separated by comma.
SSLv2 is always disabled. At least one protocol should be given to accept TLS connections.

If set to \fB1\fP, \fBtrue\fP or \fByes\fP, no buffering will be performed in the TCP stack.

.TP
\fBtcp_send_buffer_bytes\fP=\fIbuffer_size\fP
.TP
\fBtcp_recv_buffer_bytes\fP=\fIbuffer_size\fP
Specify send/recv buffer sizes in bytes.  The default value depends on operating system.

.TP

.TP
\fBbackground\fP=\fI000000\fP
These options override the colors used internally by \fBxrdp\fP(8) to draw the login and log windows.
Colors are defined using a hexadecimal (hex) notation for the combination of Red, Green, and Blue color values (RGB).
The lowest value that can be given to one of the light sources is 0 (hex 00).
The highest value is 255 (hex FF).

.SH "LOGGING"
The following parameters can be used in the \fB[Logging]\fR section:

.TP
\fBLogFile\fR=\fI/var/log/xrdp.log\fR
This options contains the path to logfile. It can be either absolute or relative.\fR

.TP
\fBLogLevel\fR=\fIlevel\fR
This option can have one of the following values:

\fBCORE\fR or \fB0\fR \- Log only core messages. these messages are _always_ logged, regardless the logging level selected.

\fBERROR\fR or \fB1\fR \- Log only error messages

\fBWARNING\fR, \fBWARN\fR or \fB2\fR \- Logs warnings and error messages

\fBINFO\fR or \fB3\fR \- Logs errors, warnings and informational messages

\fBDEBUG\fR or \fB4\fR \- Log everything. If \fBsesman\fR is compiled in debug mode, this options will output many more low\-level message, useful for developers

.TP
\fBEnableSyslog\fR=\fI[true|false]\fR
If set to \fB1\fR, \fBtrue\fR or \fByes\fR this option enables logging to syslog. Otherwise syslog is disabled.

.TP
\fBSyslogLevel\fR=\fIlevel\fR
This option sets the logging level for syslog. It can have the same values of \fBLogLevel\fR. If \fBSyslogLevel\fR is greater than \fBLogLevel\fR, its value is lowered to that of \fBLogLevel\fR.

.SH "CHANNELS"
The Remote Desktop Protocol supports several channels, which are used to transfer additional data like sound, clipboard data and others.
Channel names not listed here will be blocked by \fBxrdp\fP.
Not all channels are supported in all cases, so setting a value to \fItrue\fP is a prerequisite, but does not force its use.
.br
Channels can also be enabled or disabled on a per connection basis by prefixing each setting with \fBchannel.\fP in the channel section.

.TP
